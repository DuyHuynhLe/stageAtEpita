  abstract	= {In digital topology, the use of a pair of connectivities
		  is required to avoid topological paradoxes. In mathematical
		  morphology, self-dual operators and methods also rely on
		  such a pair of connectivities. There are several major
		  issues: self-duality is impure, the image graph structure
		  depends on the image values, it impacts the way small
		  objects and texture are processed, and so on. A sub-class
		  of images defined on the cubical grid, {\it well-composed}
		  images, has been proposed, where all connectivities are
		  equivalent, thus avoiding many topological problems. In
		  this paper we unveil the link existing between the notion
		  of well-composed images and the morphological tree of
		  shapes. We prove that a well-composed image has a
		  well-defined tree of shapes. We also prove that the only
		  self-dual well-composed interpolation of a 2D image is
		  obtained by the median operator. What follows from our
		  results is that we can have a purely self-dual
		  representation of images, and consequently, purely
		  self-dual operators.}

		  images, namely the tree of shapes, the state-of-the-art
		  algorithms do not have a satisfactory time complexity.
		  Furthermore the proposed algorithms are only effective for
		  2D images and they are far from being simple to implement.
		  That is really penalizing since a self-dual represen-
		  tation of images is a structure that gives rise to many
		  powerful operators and applications, and that could be very
		  useful for 3D images. In this paper we propose a
		  simple-to-write algorithm to compute the tree of shapes; it
		  works for nD images and has a quasi-linear complexity when
		  data quantization is low, typically 12 bits or less. To get
		  that result, this paper introduces a novel representation
		  of images that has some amazing properties of continuity,
		  while remaining discrete.}
