\chapter{Introduction}

With the increasing use of digital image capturing devices, such as digital cameras, mobile phones and PDAs, content-based image analysis techniques are receiving intensive attention in recent years. Among all the contents in images, text information has inspired great interests, since it can be easily understood by both human and computer, and finds
wide applications such as license plate reading, sign detection and translation, mobile text recognition, content-based web image search, and so on.


My internship took place during 6 months from mid Mars to mid September at LRDE, EPITA Research and Development Laboratory. I joint the Olena team with the task to experiment the ideal of using morphological tools in the field of text detection in natural images. As the morphological tools has good properties in reserving shape, especially one class of morphological tool: connected operators, we arm to develop a text detection method that has smallest impact on text form. We also take advantage of the well-composed theory so that the algorithm could treat dark-over-bright and bright-over-dark subjects the same way.


The internship include a bibliography study part where I did not only research state of art of text detection methods but also the digital topology and well-composedness and the less-famous morphology class of operator: connected operators. The next part of this internship was dedicated to design and implementation of the whole chain of text detection. In the final part, I optimized the performance of this algorithm.
