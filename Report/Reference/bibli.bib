By pruning that tree, it will reduce the number of character candidates. Text candidate will then be constructed by  single-link clustering algorithm. Text candidates will then be filtered by a character classifier (not mentioned) using smothness (average difference of adjacent boundary), stroke width, height, width, ratio.

		  is required to avoid topological paradoxes. In mathematical
		  morphology, self-dual operators and methods also rely on
		  such a pair of connectivities. There are several major
		  issues: self-duality is impure, the image graph structure
		  depends on the image values, it impacts the way small
		  objects and texture are processed, and so on. A sub-class
		  of images defined on the cubical grid, {\it well-composed}
		  images, has been proposed, where all connectivities are
		  equivalent, thus avoiding many topological problems. In
		  this paper we unveil the link existing between the notion
		  of well-composed images and the morphological tree of
		  shapes. We prove that a well-composed image has a
		  well-defined tree of shapes. We also prove that the only
		  self-dual well-composed interpolation of a 2D image is
		  obtained by the median operator. What follows from our
		  results is that we can have a purely self-dual
		  representation of images, and consequently, purely
		  self-dual operators.}

		  images, namely the tree of shapes, the state-of-the-art
		  algorithms do not have a satisfactory time complexity.
		  Furthermore the proposed algorithms are only effective for
		  2D images and they are far from being simple to implement.
		  That is really penalizing since a self-dual represen-
		  tation of images is a structure that gives rise to many
		  powerful operators and applications, and that could be very
		  useful for 3D images. In this paper we propose a
		  simple-to-write algorithm to compute the tree of shapes; it
		  works for nD images and has a quasi-linear complexity when
		  data quantization is low, typically 12 bits or less. To get
		  that result, this paper introduces a novel representation
		  of images that has some amazing properties of continuity,
		  while remaining discrete.}

abstract = {Text detection and recognition in natural images have conventionally been seen in the prior art as autonomous tasks executed in a strictly sequential processing chain with limited information sharing between sub-systems. This approach is flawed because it introduces (1) redundancy in extracting the same text properties multiple times and (2) error by prohibiting verification of hard (often binarized) detection results at later stages. We explore the possibilities for integration of detection and recognition modules by a feedforward multidimensional information stream. Integration involves suitable characterization of the text string at detection and application of the knowledge to ease recognition by a given OCR system. The choice of characterization properties generally depends on the OCR system, although some of them have proven universally applicable. We show that the proposed integration measures enable more robust recognition of text in complex, unconstrained natural environments. Specifically, integration by the proposed measures (1) eliminates textual input irregularities that recognition engines cannot handle and (2) adaptively tunes the recognition stage for each input image. The former function boosts correct detections, while the latter mainly reduces the number of false positives. Our validation experiments on a set of low-quality natural images show that adaptively tuning the OCR stage to the typical text-to-background transitions in the input image (gradient significance profiling) allows to attain an improvement of 29% in the precision-recall performance, mostly through boosting precision.},
